This blog documents me working through through [Brenda Romero](https://brenda.games/) and [Ian Schreiber](https://twitter.com/ianschreiber)'s wonderfull book 
[Challenges for game designers](https://www.worldcat.org/title/challenges-for-game-designers/oclc/319585837) in hopes of improving my game design abilities.

Hope you will have fun while following along with me on this exciting journey!


# Who am I?

Glad you asked, I'm Andy Kirpach! I am a software engineer born in Russia and currently based in Tokyo.

By daytime, I work on AR/XR/VR experiences for enterprise, art, and accessibility.

At night, I scour the streets in search of innovative mechanics and exciting ways of telling stories through games.

My dream is to make someone cry with my games (but, like, in a good way!!)
