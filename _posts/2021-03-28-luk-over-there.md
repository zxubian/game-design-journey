*The Frog Tsarevna by Ivan Bilibin*

## The Challenge

 - Mechanic: "race to the end"
 - Constraints: 2-4 players, board- or card-based
 - Approach: start with theme

## The Game

### Elevator pitch
In this [Russian fairytale-inspired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frog_Princess) game, you take on the role of a young archer who has been challenged by the Tzar: go deep into the bog-ridden forest in search of a golden arrow. Be the first to find it and the glory is yours, but be careful: the forest has a mind of its own...


### The bits

 - Deck of 49 terrain tiles, of which:
    - 1 has the golden arrow marker
	- 4 are starting positions, each matching one of the player figures in colour
    - 20 have event markers
	- 4 have stoopa markers
 - Deck of 30 event cards
 - 4 player figures
 - 1 six-sided dice (1d6)

### Rules

#### Win/Lose Conditions
 - The game ends when one of the players reaches the golden arrow located at the center of the map
 - The first player to get to the arrow wins, the other players loose

#### Setup

 - Remove the golden arrow and the starting tiles from the terrain tile deck
 - Shuffle the terrain tiles, and place them face down in a deck
 - Place the yellow starting position tile at the top left corner, then proceed to take the terrain cards from the deck one at a time, flipping them face up and placing them on the grid. When you reach the other corners, place the respective starting position tile, as per the diagram. When you reach the middle fo the grid, place the golden arrow tile
 - Each player picks chooses one player figure and places it on the starting position of the same color at one of the map corners

#### Round Structure

 - Each round consists of several turns
 - Unless stated otherwise, each player plays one turn each round
 - Rounds follow clock-wise in the order of starting positions, starting with the youngest player

#### Turn Structure

On your turn, you:
 - roll 1 die to determine how many spaces you can move forward
 - move that number of spaces along the path in any direction

If during movement you cross from one tile to another, pause and perform the following:
 - roll 1 die
 - multiply 45 by the result of the roll
 - rotate the tile you just left clockwise by the result of the previous step (in angles)
     - Dice result -> how much to turn by
     - 1 or 5 -> 1/4 a turn
	 - 2 or 6 ->  1/2 a turn
	 - 3      ->  3/4 a turn
	 - 4      -> no turn

#### Events
  - When entering an event tile, draw an event card and follow the instructions on the card
  - Unless the card states otherwise, the event takes effect immediately, interrupting your turn
  - After completing the instructions on the card, continue with your turn, unless the card states otherwise
